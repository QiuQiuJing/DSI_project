10,"Please keep in mind I'm fairly new to this stuff so I'm sorry if I'm not fully descriptive or anything.My computer ran horribly about a couple weeks ago for no reason. CPU was maxing out out of the blue. Games went from 60fps to 3fps. I decided after lots of researching to factory reset my computer, completely clean it and I did so.I also decided to add the new windows update, I then ran Minecraft and it said I ran into a problem. It said my driver couldn't support opengl. I followed every tutorial online and none worked. My graphics card is updated to the latest driverGPU: GTX 1060 6GBI haven't been able to test on other games yet tho so idk if it's just Minecraft. I then thought to myself that it could be the newest update of windows. I searched everywhere how to go back to older windows update but nothing was working for me. Trust me, I tried everything.So at this point, I'm stuck. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm doing one step wrong or what not. If anybody has a solution or anything to suggest, please. I would great appreciate it. Thank you so much for reading all this if you did.TLDR; I tried to run Minecraft, didn't work. Updated driver to newest update but didn't work.

13,"So I upgraded to 1903 to see how it was. Before this feature update, I have had virtually no problems with previous builds. So, the first problem I encountered is that the context menu is extremely funky. When I would right-click folders and application shortcuts, I would get an infinite spinning cursor as if my system was trying to load up something. This forced me to restart Explorer in task manager, but it was merely a bandaid for the issue. Context menus worked for almost everything else though, so it isn't my mouse that is acting up. I tried running SFC and DISM in cmd to figure out if there were any errors, but there were none.Secondly, and this is a weird one, but games that have VAC enabled would boot me from servers when I would join. Something I did not experience on previous builds. I tried the workarounds for the VAC issue but to no avail.And finally, this build is comparatively more sluggish than previous builds for me. I just ended up ragequitting due to problems adding themselves on top of other problems that I just reverted back to 1809, whenever 1903 wasn't being a buggy mess at least, because going into the Settings app to revert was sometimes troublesome, too.Since managing to revert back to 1809, I've yet to experience any of the aforementioned problems. Knock on wood. I didn't know where to officially post bug reports, so I thought this would suffice.",windows

46,"Good evening all,I've  been stuck with this for 3 days straight while working on this for a  week. I am trying to successfully set up a MDT server the deploy and  capture images with. I am doing this on a couple VMs. Both the MDT  server and the host are VMs. The server is running Microsoft Server 2016  and the test VM that I'm trying to deploy the image on is running  Windows 10 (1809). I believe that I have set everything up correctly. On  the server I have* DHCP installed: The address I set for the server is [192.168.198.3](https://192.168.198.3/)  so the scope that I used is from .3 to .20. I am using an outside  Primary and Secondary DNS server (don't know if this is relevant). These  devices are using VMwares NAT addressing. I've reserved the .3 address  so it won't be used (the step when setting up DHCP that ask if want to  exclude IPs)* Microsoft Deployment Toolkit: I have set everything up following the instructions found in this article [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/windows-10-poc-mdt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/windows-10-poc-mdt).  I've downloaded the ADK to match the Windows version I am trying to  deploy it on (ADK 1809) and seem to have set up MDT with no problems at  all. I've also been able to set up a Deployment file as well as both a  x86 and a x64 WIM file respectively* Windows  Deployment Services: I set up TFTP on the server as well. I have also  set up WDS successfully to the point where I can add WIM files. Under  the PXE Response tab, the option to see known and unknown clients is  enabled as this is used for testing and that's primarily it. For some  reason, under the Boot tab, ""require the user to press F12 key to  continue the PXE boot wasn't working for me"" so I enabled the setting to  ""Always continue the PXE boot""I shared out the Deployment share that was created by MDT. Here is a screenshot of how the permissions look.[https://imgur.com/1bX03jc](https://imgur.com/1bX03jc)I've  read somewhere that you have to make an administrator on a local  account with read only permissions (I did this but had to use the saved  snapshot because updates messed up the VM) but to no avail it still  didn't work.On the client side* Domain:  I've joined the computer to the domain. All firewalls are off on both  this client and the server. The client can ping the server just fine and  I've entered the servers IP address as the client's DNS.* Script:  Logging into the computer via an account on the domain allows me to  navigate to the scripts folder in the Deployment share folder. I can run  the script fine logged in. I didn't let the process run through of  deploying.* IP  Address: After hitting F12 and choosing either the x86 or x64 WIM, it  loads, a quick CMD pops up and disappears and I get the the error and  then I hit F8.

So a separate user won't be able to do much more than what I can already do.

I have a headset that can devide chat (discord) and games so that you can balance them on the headset/controlbox. Cant hear your friends? One click and a scroll on a wheel and you have turned up chat sound and down the game.It has worked fine for the passed year that I have had the headset, but all of a sudden, I hit trouble. If I join a chat-room all sound from running apps disapears. The odd thing is, that If I restart them (close chrome and start it up again) it has sound. Even more weird is that I can change chat-rooms without issues as long as its in the same channel. If I go to another channel, it happens again...it seems like the Game output gets deactivated, tho its not, and is still the default device.I know there is a fix to deactivate one of the output channels for the headset, but that either means I have to not use the chat/game balance (which I use ALOT) or having to go into the playback settings -&gt; Deactivate -&gt; reactivate, everytime I move to another channel.I cant find any muting option in discord, so my last guess is that windows is actually disconnecting the sounds from each app that is running when going into the chat-room. Just cant find something like that anywhere.I cant discribe how weird I find this, as it just happened out of no where. I have made no changes to the whole setup, so it just happened on its own.I hope someone has a fix out there :) Update.I manually just deactivated the Communicationsdevice and when I activated it again the defaultdevice (game) just went silent, tho it didnt change being the default device...I have also made sure its not windows, as its set to do nothing.

156,"So I recently bought a cheap third monitor, purely for the purpose of being like a digital sticky note. I just wanted to be able to throw simple text-based stuff on there without getting in the way of my other two monitors. The monitor is about 7 inches long and has a 720p resolution.Because of this, all the text is really small and I can't read it from where it is on my desk. Naturally, I went to increase the display scaling, but it was greyed out. I googled it, did any solution I could find, but no matter way, this 3rd monitor's scaling won't let me change it. (It's set at 100% if that matters)Windows said that I needed to log out to change it, but even after doing that, it's still locked. (Although it did unlock the scaling for my other two monitors.) This mini monitor is connected to my CPU, as opposed to my other 2, which are connected to the graphics card. (There were no more free spots in my graphics card.)One of the other solutions I read online was turning on ""Maintain Aspect Ratio"" in Intel's HD Graphics Control Panel. I do that, but immediately after hitting ""apply"" it sets itself back to ""Maintain display scaling"", which I assume is why it's locked in Window's display settings.Interestingly enough, if I lower the resolution of the display, the scaling unlocks, but it will only let me scale it up to make up for the lost resolution.  Also, for whatever reason, the lower resolutions that it lets me select from don't match the aspect ratio of the display. (16:9)Of course, I tried all the typical solutions, restarting, I reinstalling/updating the Intel drivers, etc.  I'm at my wit's end.

177,"After the AMA, I decided to dig a little bit and see if there is some information that might be interesting for the community. Here are the results:Ad-blocking/Manifest V3: &gt; At Build, we started to talk about some specific commitments around user privacy and the quality of the browsing experience, as well as our goal to be customer-focused in terms of how we build the platform and when we intervene on the user’s behalf. One specific example is the tracking protection features we announced at Build; we also hear from many customers that access to robust content blocking solutions is super important to their browsing experiences.&gt; In the specific case of the extension Manifest V3 changes being discussed in the Chromium community, we are in ongoing discussions with a number of popular extension developers and with the Chromium community to understand both the technical merits and the impact to developers and customers of the proposed changes. We’ll share more details about how we will proceed in Microsoft Edge once we work through those discussions and feedback from developers and the community. - Kyle*Edit regarding Manifest V3:* &gt; We want to be careful not to jump the gun here and it's a complex issue with both technical merits (see some of Google's recent blogs on the issue) and potential impact to extension developers and users. So we want to be thorough in doing our homework before making a decision. We definitely hear your feedback and that's a key input in our decision making. &gt; I know ""we don't know yet"" is unsatisfying, but it's the truth! - KyleEdge in other Windows devices (Xbox/Hololens/etc), conversion to UWP to an extend: &gt; Our goal is to get the next version of Microsoft Edge working on all of our Microsoft devices. So Edge will eventually be coming to those platforms but we can't make any promises around when that will be. - ZoherEdge in Linux: &gt; We don't have any technical blockers to keep us from creating Linux binaries, and it's definitely something we'd like to do down the road. That being said, there is still work to make them ""customer ready"" (installer, updaters, user sync, bug fixes, etc.) and something we are proud to give to you, so we aren't quite ready to commit to the work just yet.&gt; Right now, we are super focused on bringing stable versions of Edge first to other versions of Windows (as well as macOS), and then releasing our Beta channels. That said, we love hearing the ask and especially love details if this is important to your test infrastructure or elsewhere in your development lifecycle so we can continue to validate and prioritize this work! - SeanIE11: &gt; Regarding IE11 and IE mode: IE11 will continue to be supported on the life cycle of the OS and won't be removed. More info here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17454/lifecycle-faq-internet-explorer. IE mode is enabled via the Enterprise Mode Site List tool that we shipped in IE11 and enabled through Group Policy. It's targeted towards Enterprises but if a regular user gets industrious, it would work. IE mode will work where IE11 is currently supported, so all supported versions of Windows. Hope this helps regarding IE mode!

Colleen*[EDIT]* Forking Chromium:&gt; We have chosen not to fork since we don't want to fragment the community, but our infrastructure does allow us to maintain patches for cases where we have a different point of view on individual changes (we talked about the webRequest/Manifest V3 changes in a couple other places - see [https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/c094uf/hi\_reddit\_were\_the\_team\_behind\_microsoft\_edge\_and/er2yqsk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/c094uf/hi_reddit_were_the_team_behind_microsoft_edge_and/er2yqsk/)). In general we plan to upstream our web platform improvements to the Chromium project. - Kyle*[EDIT2]* Web apps:&gt;We've always supported both UWP and Web apps and will continue to support them. The main change will be that developers will soon have the option to run their new web apps on the Chromium engine which will make it easier for app developers that already build and test their sites and apps in Chromium-based browsers.*[EDIT2]* PlayReady:&gt; Edge supports both Microsoft PlayReady and Google Widevine DRM systems. With PlayReady, Edge is the only hardware-backed content protection available in any browser on Windows which gives content providers the confidence they need to deliver 4K premium and 1080p content. -J.T.

It was the kind of symptom you'd expect if a display cable were loose.Obviously, I checked to make sure my display port cable wasn't loose.

What's more, I am **almost positive** that I have solved the issue by updating my graphics drivers.I just want to know if anyone else experienced these issues, or anything similar, after the big update, so I can know if I should be worried that maybe it's a coincidence and my monitor really is dying.",windows

215,"Via [the Steam Community](https://steamcommunity.com/games/250820/announcements/detail/1600381633537138452):### SteamVR:* Fixed rare crash in vrserver.exe with certain audio devices and driver versions.* Fixed a crash in vrserver.exe when restarting Steam while SteamVR is running (only possible if SteamVR is not launched from Steam).* Fix a crash if SteamVR is started while Steam is sitting at a login prompt.* Fixed Steam crashing when SteamVR was launched and 'Enable GPU Profiling' was enabled.* Fixed a crash when running through Windows Remote Desktop.* Updated Base Station 2.0 Channel Configuration UI for more clarity.* Fixed issue with internal scene transitions in applications which use IVRApplications::LaunchInternalProcess within the first 60 seconds of the application starting up. One example of this is entering Secret Shop or Aperture Robot Repair in The Lab.* Fix some issues that could lead to SteamVR hangs.* Fixed right clicking on the status window in the new ""Searching..."" and ""Standby"" states.* Moved the “Searching…” popup into the main status window.* Added a “Standby” status for when the HMD isn’t being worn.* Added Debug Commands interface (under Developer menu).Driver RunFrame calls to PollNextEvent throttled to 1s of event processing. This is an attempt to work around cases where calls to driver RunFrame never return, in the case where it is due to constant event processing. This has been observed in some drivers when they are processing wireless haptic events. Drivers that are throttled will almost immediately be called again in RunFrame after other system housekeeping is done.* Deprecate driver-supplied Prop_DoNotApplyPrediction_Bool. (See Windows MR notes for more information).* Add a per-driver “loadPriority” (higher is earlier loading) to control the order that we check drivers for available HMDs. The default loadPriority is 0. Drivers can set a different default in resources/settings/default.vrsettings. The user can override those settings in their personal steam/config/steamvr.vrsettings file. Drivers with the same priority continue to be loaded in alphabetical order as before.* The default null driver loadPriority (which has historically been forced to be “last”) is -999.* The default iVRy driver loadPriority is -100 because it takes a fixed 5 seconds to initialize even when not in use. Users of iVRy should not notice any change.* Set the default load priority for driver_kinoni to -800 because it always claims to have an HMD (which will block access to any later drivers).* The default AMD WVR driver (part of AMD “Relive”) loadPriority is -900 because it will always claim to have an HMD (previously because it started with “a” it would block access to all other actual HMDs whenever it was installed).### SteamVR Home: * Changed held object color picker to be easier to use with thumbsticks* Fixed held object color picker sometimes unintentionally causing snap turns* changed held object color picker to only engage on trackpad press on Index controllers* increased thickness of held object color picker hue ring* Fix for incorrect tool entity position (was causing tool sounds to be incorrectly spatialized).* Consolidate config files to use a single _vr suffix, instead of a per-controller suffix. This reduces loss of user flags such as whether or not they’ve completed the tutorial.### SteamVR Input: * Fixed issue binding vector1 actions to Boolean inputs* Fixed issue hot-reloading action manifests (fixes unreal SteamVR input plugin)* Fixed issue with certain legacy titles not being able to set default bindings on the Steam partner site.* Fixed issue with controller binding UI in-headset showing a small blank rectangle instead of UI.* Added ability to bind boolean inputs to vector1 actions. * Added headers to action selection window in binding interface.* Added callout for required actions in binding interface.* Fixed “Pretend to be this type of controller” button looking wrong if nothing was set at all.* Fixed double-click while publishing a binding actually publishing two copies.* Changed the default name when publishing a binding or saving a favorite to include the user’s Persona name rather than the old (usually default) binding name.### Oculus: * Updated Oculus SDK to 1.37.0.* Added icons and controller render models for Rift S.* When Oculus Guardian is updated while SteamVR is running, update Chaperone automatically without requiring a restart.* Fixed thumbstick animation for Rift CV1 controller render models.* Fixed warning not popping up when the user has an outdated version of the Oculus software.* Switched all Rift haptics to use the non-buffered API (the old API is deprecated).* When Rift S is used, don't show tracking camera icons.### Windows MR: * **When using third-party software to mix Windows MR HMDs with non-MR trackers and controllers, correctly predict poses for the non-MR devices. (Currently the MR driver supplies already predicted poses, and uses an HMD velocity of zero to prevent HMD pose extrapolation.)*** **Avoid a crash after 30+ minutes of runtime when the driver backs up on haptic commands.**### Valve Index: * Always treat thumbsticks as touched when they are moved away from the center.* Updated Hidden Area Mesh for Index HMD to better account for canting, increase stereo overlap, and to better accommodate re-projection.### Valve Index Headset Firmware (v1559778800): * Improved AMD support (across all frame-rates)* USB-C (VirtualLink) auto-detection### Linux: * Temporarily disabled vrwebhelper functionality. For testing purposes it can be re-enabled by setting STEAMVR_WEBHELPER=1 in your environment.* Fixed crashes in vrwebhelper.* Fixed a hang in vrserver during SteamVR shutdown.* Fixed the flickering black box on the vrmonitor UI when the VR Mirror View was open.### Compositor:* Fixed a Motion Smoothing related crash on AMD hardware.* Fixed startup crash when trying to use wireless on unsupported hardware.* Added support for DXGI_FORMAT_R32G8X24_TYPELESS textures passed as depth from applications.* Added support for passing left-handed projection matrices when supplying additional depth info.",windows
216,"Hi there !Been looking around for some time, but I believe my issue is too specific and Google didn't have the answer, so I hope someone here will know how to do.I found out that it was possible to disable Windows snapping on Windows 10 (settings -&gt; System -&gt; Multitasking -&gt; Uncheck Snap) and I was quite happy about it because I hate how this ""feature"" works especially since I use two monitors and I frequently get stuck in the middle even when moving windows quite fast from one monitor to the other. So I removed that feature and all good so far....only to find out that it also prevents me from moving fullscreen windows, for instance a maximized web browser. It also disables the windows+arrow shortcuts. I have to minimize / window them to be able to move. What. The. Hell. I tried different workaround : I use DisplayFusion to have two different taskbars and it has a feature allowing to move maximized windows accross two monitors, but it's not ideal, it doesn't work as smooth as the original Windows feature. Checking the ""prevent windows from being automatically arranged when moved to the edge of the screen"" does exactly the same result, bsically all it does is disabling Snap. My question is the following :1. Is there a way to disable windows being stuck at the edge of monitors when dragging them without deactivating Snap, as it also prevents you from moving windows at all2. If not, is there a way to disable Snap without losing the ability to drag fullscreen windows from one monitor to the other ?Thank you in advance for your help !",windows

236,"I have been facing this problem EVERY time when I dual boot, and that is having Linux messing up Windows time because Windows uses local time instead of UTC. It is possible to make Linux use local time, yes, but UTC is often better as stated on this [AskUbuntu answer](https://askubuntu.com/a/800965):&gt; The advantage of having the hardware clock as UTC is that you don't need to change the hardware clock when moving between timezones or when Daylight Savings Time (DST) begins or ends as UTC does not have DST or timezone offsets. I think it would be better for Microsoft to make Windows use UTC instead of local time. It would both fix the dual boot time problem and open up more possibilities for more time-related features such as DST, multiple time zones, etc.",windows

246,"Last weekend my Dad gave me an installation disk for Windows 10 Pro that he purchased in June 2018 for his own use.  Shortly after purchasing the software, he decided to buy a new computer instead that had Windows 10 already installed, thus he never installed the software.This disk he gave me is a full version,with the original disk and it is not OEM.  However, prior to installing on my own system, I wanted to make sure the product key was valid.  So I called Microsoft.  The support person was difficult to understand, but what I made out of the conversation was this.  The product key is valid and it has not been used.  However, this was purchased from a ""Microsoft Business Partner"".  To install this, I will need to contact that business partner... and that's where things got difficult to understand.  So I am unsure what to do now.Here is the background.  My Dad used to build systems all the time but is 93 years old now and just not anywhere as sharp as he used to be.  He told me that he couldn't remember where he bought the kisk, but thought it was either at Wal-Mart or Sams Club.  So in his mind he bought it at a retail store.  My guess after hearing this Microsoft Business Partner phrase, is that he probably bought it off of eBay.  I can probably find out pretty easy by having him get into his ebay account.* So what exactly is a Microsoft Business Partner?  Is this a company who buys Microsoft products in bulk?If so, my thought is that this could have been stolen from a company and sold on eBay.  Or, it could be a company that may have had an extra copy they didn't need and legitimately sold it on eBay.In any case, to save me the headache of having my dad try and figure out where he got it (OMG, I never want to get old), I first off need to find out:* Do fellow Redditors think it is worth pursuing?  * Also, if it WAS a legit sale, how do I go about activating it?

I service thousands of laptops every year and this is the first time in my life that I witnessed it. A customer laptop had a bad drive, so, I changed it and installed Windows 10 1903 from a fresh Media Creation Tool created USB key.   I did a first batch of updates after the OOBE, reboot. Good. Did a second batch and when it reboot the laptop to apply updates, it went to ASUS Easy Flash and flashed a new BIOS.  This is pretty scary.

290,"Sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong place or not doing this right, I'm not really used to posting on reddit at all.So I bought a new Surface Pro 6 back in December 2018 because the HDD and GPU on my Pro 3 were kicking the bucket. I swear to god I remember turning on System Protection for backups when I first got it so I didn't lose a shit load of artwork like I previously did.I wanted to install Unity on my Surface but I didn't have enough space for the program files or game project files. So I thought, ""Let's get this OneDrive shit out of here!"" I was under the impression that my Surface was backing up everything that was in my pictures and documents folder because all of it would show up in my OneDrive folder as well. So I went to delete things from the OneDrive folder, and it said files were too large to delete so I just clicked ""okay"" or whatever. I figured it was deleting the HUNDREDS of backups of photos from my old phone that were sitting in my OneDrive. Me being the idiot I am didn't make a backup, although in my defense I wasn't expecting deleting OneDrive backups to completely delete all of my photos and documents on my Surface. Literally all of my photos and documents are gone now. Days and days of work on illustration projects just gone out the window.So none of these files from my new Surface actually got uploaded into my OneDrive. I go and log into OneDrive on my browser and none of them are there. Nothing in the recycling bin there either. I'm super depressed right now because I put so much time and effort into all of this art for it to just disappear without warning. Also when I open the Start Menu, I can see it cycling through thumbnails of things I've drawn recently, but they don't exist anywhere?Tl;dr: I deleted files from my OneDrive folder on my Surface to free up space, but it completely deleted all of my original files. Am I totally boned or is there actually a way to recover these files? I know there are recovery programs but I don't know of any good ones that aren't super in your face with ads or blocking useful features with a ridiculous paywall. Why in the hell is OneDrive linked to my files like that? Just trying to figure this shit out so it doesn't happen again.Also I know I should have made a backup and shouldn't have clicked perma delete, I learned my lesson so don't rub it in please. This is a huge mental bomb for me because my artwork is super important to me... I just want some genuine advice or help, no condescending nonsense. :\^(Edit: grammar and clarification",windows

Now, I have one screen connected by VGA, but my graphics card (Geforce RTX 2060) only has 3xDP and 1xHDMI input. That's why I bought a VGA to DP adapter. I didn't want to connect it to HDMI because I also have a second screen which I want to use. For simplicity, assume that I'm not using the second screen we only deal with the one with VGA here.I'm pretty sure that the cable and the adapter work because I can reach it to the BIOS and Safe Mode without any blinks/black screens etc. However, as soon as I reach the normal Windows with the welcoming screen where you enter your password/PIN, the screen immediately starts blinking, ""no signal"" randomly or even turns off at some point.I tried to force and install the monitor's drivers (by default, Windows 10 downloaded some generic PnP ones), reinstall the graphics card drivers and still nothing. I also followed some generic steps on the internet about black screens but no results. I also notice by experimenting that if I don't do anything (e.g. I open the task manager and kill all NVIDIA related tasks) it blinks less, but as soon as I open the browser to write this post, it blinks/turns off more. Maybe that's also something related.I would be really grateful if you could give me some suggestions.

319," Everyone,I am besides myself. About a week ago, I noticed various programs within Microsoft Windows behaved in a very strange way. Upon opening them, anything displayed that had enough information to have a vertical scroll would immediately scroll to the bottom. I noticed this with parts of programs within Windows itself only. Things like Microsoft Store, Outlook, or if I tried to open Apps in Settings I couldn't look at anything except for whatever would be at the bottom of the scroll. If I tried to scroll up, it would immediately force the scroll back to the bottom.Now to be clear, this wouldn't happen for programs not within Windows. If I opened Chrome, the behavior would be normal, no scrolling. Firefox, games, you name the other type of software, it wouldn't occur; only programs within Microsoft Windows.I have wracked my mind trying to solve this problem. I've switched mice (even though I couldn't see how that would be the culprit with all other mouse behaviors in other programs being normal), and looked at all my setting and tried my best to fix it on my own.I finally went nuclear and reset the PC to factory conditions, SAME behavior in the same Microsoft Windows programs. I cannot imagine what could cause this or what next diagnostic step I could take to figure this out.Does anyone know what could cause this; is it a known issue? What can I do to solve the problem?​Any help is much appreciated.Thank you!",windows

346,"  Hi, So after a long time I've finally decided to clean my trusty Windows tablet and install fresh system on it. I didn’t bothered upgrading it from 1803 to 1903 so I prepared fresh 32bit iso, installed from the USB and noticed during the installation wizard that touch is not detected (is working in UEFI/BIOS). Installation is done, all available updates pulled, some devices not detected but after searching via Window Update most of Intel drivers are installed. And now I'm trapped as I still do miss loads of drivers that there were working on 1803 and now this tablet is just a ""brick"" on 1903. But let’s list the problems:\- Batteries section is not detected in the device manager, system not recognise battery nor charger, no status of charge (tablet is charging as in UEFI I can check the charge status and battery health) HWINFO is detecting battery\- Touchscreen is not working (is working in UEFI as I can select options in configuration)\- Front and Rear camera not detected (can't test it anywhere else)\- Audio is not working (going via troubleshooting is not detecting anything wrong, yet still no sound)    [https://imgur.com/a/T58M2Im](https://imgur.com/a/T58M2Im)    Sorry for non English language.

357,"Hey everyone :)  So, I wrote a post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@InternetJohnny/why-i-never-use-shutdown-on-windows-89a5d8e536f3) about this, and wanted to see what the general consensus is on the topic of turning off your computer.To summarize the post:## ShutdownIt does turn off your computer, but makes it so that it takes the longest to run back on. I never use it (**Unless there's updates pending**, then I will finish work and shutdown/reboot)**Computer off?** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**Startup speed:** ⭐## SleepIf you’re going to be **away from the computer for a few minutes**, this is the best option. Super fast startup time However, since it is using RAM,  it also uses more battery. Additionally, if by any chance you remove the battery (laptop) or the power goes out (desktop), everything is lost because it is being stored in volatile memory.**Computer off?** ⭐⭐**Startup speed:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐## HibernateHibernate is the love child of Sleep and Shutdown. It seems like the best of both worlds, and the best option if  you’re going to be **away for longer, or want to turn off your computer.**Because it **takes a snapshot of everything** currently happening on the computer and saves it , this means that when you start your computer, everything you were using before is opened again.There are some apps I *always* keep open whenever I’m on the computer:* Whatsapp* Slack* Brave* NotionShould I close them every time I turn the computer off, if I’ll have to open them again when I turn it on? I don't think so.**Computer off?** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**Startup speed:** ⭐⭐⭐~~------------~~Maybe I'm missing something, so if you know any benefit to shutting down instead of hibernating (or sleeping), please let me know.EDIT:  As a few people have pointed out, shutting down (or rebooting) allows the computer to “reset”, and also to install any pending updates.Personally, I reboot my computer at least once a week, just to make sure everything keeps running smoothly. If I get a notification saying *Windows needs to perform an update*, I will reboot as soon as I am done with my work (and so should you).",windows

383,"First of all, it's not a trolling attempt as I was genuinely surprised to see that (yes, it is what a troll would say).I find it interesting that Windows 10 software license terms (Home and Pro, OEM and Retail) have this part:&gt;The software may include H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and/or VC-1 decoding technology. MPEG LA, L.L.C. requires this notice:  &gt;  &gt;THIS PRODUCT IS LICENSED UNDER THE AVC, THE VC-1, AND THE MPEG-4 PART 2 VISUAL PATENT PORTFOLIO LICENSES FOR THE PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE OF A CONSUMER TO (i) ENCODE VIDEO IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ABOVE STANDARDS (“VIDEO STANDARDS”) AND/OR (ii) DECODE AVC, VC-1, AND MPEG-4 PART 2 VIDEO THAT WAS ENCODED BY A CONSUMER ENGAGED IN A PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AND/OR WAS OBTAINED FROM A VIDEO PROVIDER LICENSED TO PROVIDE SUCH VIDEO. NO LICENSE IS GRANTED OR SHALL BE IMPLIED FOR ANY OTHER USE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED FROM MPEG LA, L.L.C. SEE (AKA.MS/MPEGLA).Obligation to include notices of this kind is a part of typical agreement with MPEG LA, L.L.C., a patent holder in the sphere of video coding standards. For those interested, a PDF example of agreement can be found on the web ([link](http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/MPEG_LA_on__Internet_Broadcast_AVC_Video__licensing_and_non_private_use.html), scroll to the middle of a blog post).IANAL plus English is not my native language, but it looks to me as if it tells that Windows is not intended for commercial use (I am not about bugs). I suppose they wrote only about patented technologies here, but even in this case I think a customer of Windows assumes it is not a bad thing to watch or encode H.264 for business needs (i.e. I can imagine employee training with video opened in Movies and TV app).A number of Microsoft products such as Skype share a common Microsoft Services Agreement ([link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/)) that also include MPEG LA part and there it is followed by an additional statement:&gt;For clarification purposes only, this notice does not limit or inhibit the use of the software provided under these Terms for normal business uses that are personal to that business which do not include (i) redistribution of the software to third parties, or (ii) creation of material with the VIDEO STANDARDS compliant technologies for distribution to third parties.I don't know if it actually makes sense or just contradicts with MPEG LA wording, but at least it is there. The patent holder's website has a slide ([link](https://www.mpegla.com/wp-content/uploads/avcweb.pdf)) telling that their license for developers&gt;(...) Includes right to manufacture and sell AVC encoders and decoders with the right of End Users to use them for personal and consumer (including internal business) purposes without remuneration but not for other uses.I can imagine (pour) business without remuneration and I almost get what they want to say about showing Youtube cat videos to colleagues (but what if you sell cats and it is market research?). Anyway, Windows license is what it is and has no slides attached to it.In 2010 Apple, Adobe and Microsoft declined to comment when CNET asked them to clarify the scope of these notices. MPEG LA employee didn't decline but IMHO his answers did not make things better ([link](https://www.cnet.com/news/is-h-264-a-legal-minefield-for-video-pros/)).However, it is obvious that it somehow works, maybe it's just me not getting something.

However, as it states above, when I turned on my PC on this morning, all of the sites that I had marked “keep me logged in” on had been signed out. Last time something like this happened it was because there was a hack in a game I was playing and a keylogger (I assume) grabbed my info on my next login and I lost the account on that game.

You can keep adding disks, but until you get up to the 6th added disk Optimize-StoragePool won't do shit and you won't be able to extend the existing virtual disk.You may think ""of course it can't optimize the pool, there's no overhead for it to temporarily store data on the various physical disks"", but even if you create a 600GB smaller virtual disk initially (to leave about 100GB on each disk available) it still can't/won't rebalance the data so you can get the same capacity you would get  from having all of the disks added in the first place.",windows

486,"Origin article: [https://v2bv.net/2019/wsl-ssh-launcher](https://v2bv.net/2019/wsl-ssh-launcher)I'm a Linux user and recently because of some undeniable reason, I' m using Windows these days. I  haven't been using Windows for about half a year, and I got really used  to those command line tools in Linux (e,g, tmux), it's kind of  uncomfortable without them.So I enabled WSL, installed openSUSE and Arch. After  setting up my dotfiles, I found out that there is not a single usable  terminal emulator on Windows:* Windows version of Alacritty cannot display some character in the right  way. Tmux's status line become weird after stretching the window. * Fluent Terminal looks nice but tmux's status line will disappear in some cases. * ConEmu does not support dialog very well, etc.And vim does not work well in those terminal emulators, especially for syntax highlighting (colors become indistinguishable). Seems these situations are caused by ConHost and people who build those terminal emulators cannot fix that on  their own. I know they tried their best.Microsoft said they are going to fix that and released Windows Terminal at Build 2019, I'm very glad they are working on it.  But after I downloading a Dev build from their CI, I found out that:* Colors are still not 100% correct in some cases, though it's still a huge improvement from the previous ConHost.* Does not support mouse interaction (e.g. tmux's mouse mode and vim). * High CPU and RAM usage. After opening 5-6 tabs, it uses 20% of my CPU (which is a 6th-gen Shintel Core i7) and over 3GB of RAM, plus another 20% usage on CPU by Antimalware service.  Performance also become unacceptable in this case, I can even see how  each character is printed out.After searching for resolutions, I found that someone said we can use SSH clients as there are some decent SSH clients on Windows. But there are still some problems: * WSL does not have a real init system and service manager, so distributions with ""pure"" systemd only cannot start sshd as a daemon unless start by hand. * Even though some distribution can start sshd through RC scripts, it still needs some sort of interaction. Then I done a little bit of searching and found no suitable tools can start sshd  on boot (maybe it exists, but I just didn't see it). So I wrote one : )Screenshot: [https://v2bv.net/img/wsl\_ssh\_screenshot.png](https://v2bv.net/img/wsl_ssh_screenshot.png)(I think the interface is pretty straight forward)I was planning to make a UWP one but I don't know how to do it so I just made it with WPF. It's my first WPF program so… Yea it's ugly and I don't really know how to design a UI.It has the basic functionalities I need, but still, with some issues:* Window cannot be resized, because I don't know how to make it resizable in the correct way. * Microsoft says WPF supports HiDPi, but I didn't test it since I don't have that kind of device.* It cannot stop the sshd process only, instead, it will kill all the WSL instance of that specific distribution:    * I wrapped the WSL process with BackgroundWorker, but I don’t know how to stop a process inside a BackgroundWorker, my bad.   * WSL instances are isolated so I cannot start a new process and kill the process in the previous WSL instance.      * Sometimes it's not... I'm really confused.   * So I did it in this way.* Again, it's extremely ugly.* Lacks error handling. But at least it works!

498,"Ever since Windows 10's launch, feature updates have come in six month intervals. Although this may seem better than the 4 year development cycle in the past, the truth is that six months is not enough for an OS like Windows.With every feature update being rushed, new problems abound in every iteration, including the file deletion bug that plagued users last year.Apple is another example: they have issues and bugs that take a year to get patched, and their dev cycles are year long! The importance of Windows Updates is obvious. However, having to install a new build every 6 months and clean out the windows.old folder wears out computers much faster than yearly OS releases, not to mention it puts less pressure on deadlines and more on implementing features at a rapid (but reasonable) pace.Should Microsoft slow down with their releases, or is their current pace okay?",windows

526,"**About it:** 2011 Asus Notebook. Intel Core i7, intel graphics card, non-gaming laptop, Windows 7 Home Pro edition. **The problem**: When I command the computer to hybernate or sleep, it instead does either of these two. Both of them have the same premise:1. It shows a blue screen that says that the computer did not shut down properly and prompts to reboot under safe mode or regular settings. 2. It decides to restart on it's own and bypasses the prompt to reboot under normal conditions, but then comes the premise, which is shared by both....**Premise/Problem:** Windows boots up, but the screen is black and the cursor shows up in the middle of the screen. No icons appear. Nothing. Just a black canvas and your cursor. You can move the cursor around but nothing else works. You can CTRL+ALT+DEL and it will work as expected, bringing the options up. You can lock your computer and the GUI works for that. However, as long as you operate your computer in that condition, it will loop into a black screen. i.e. if you restart your computer or even shut it down, it will still show up as a black screen. The ONLY way to get the computer to start normally again is if you hard reset it by holding down the power button and powering it up again. It will bring up the prompt asking you whether you want to boot it up in safe mode or regular settings. The ONLY solution is to select safe mode and then from safe mode, restart your computer and then it works fine. **Recent Events:**As of 2 weeks ago or so, my laptop will no longer Hybernate, or sleep. I used to do it all the time without a hitch. Then in the last 2 weeks, the things that started happening which might explain why it is being like this are the following, but I am obviously not sure:1. The battery life of the laptop was always the worst aspect of the portability of the laptop. It only lasts 2.5 hours on light work and less than 45 minutes when it's heavy duty. We are talking from a 100% to uncommanded shutdown. I bought the laptop as a desktop replacement and I almost always have it plugged in so portability was not really the issue for me. However, in the last 2 weeks, I used the laptop in bed to watch movies and ended up dosing off, leading it to shutdown at least 3 times because of low battery. Obviously when this happens, the next time you power on the laptop, it asks you whether you want to boot it in safe mode or not. 2. For the first time ever, I bought a high-key travel keyboard and plugged it into the laptop whenever I use it. It's a logitech keyboard and it worked fine on my work laptop so I decided to bring it over to my personal laptop instead. It is always plugged in as long as I have my laptop on my desk. 3. I have so much stuff on this laptop that I have accumulated over the last 8 years that it (was) ridiculous. It surely slowed down my computer a lot (booting up took almost 45 minutes). However, once I got the computer to boot up properly the last time, I purged a crap ton of it, freeing almost 70 GB from my laptop today. 4. Lastly, as mentioned, this laptop is not a gaming one. Not by miles. I run 2013 games on this and it struggles like a mofo. However, at times I get giddy and try installing some new games and I run them but they either are too slow, heat up the computer that it wreaks havok on the temperature of the computer or, it just doesn't work and crashes. So I end up doing a lot of heavy installing and uninstalling within a matter of a short period of time. But this is not the first time I have been doing this. **What I am doing and what I have done already**:- As of last month, I have backed up my drives to an External Hard Drive and saved a system image backup. - I have purged a lot of old software, games and content as I said above. - I am running a full scan of my computer, with both my antivirus and windows defender.- I am going to backup my computer before I attempt to shut it down tonight. **How should I proceed?**",windows

553,"DWM could easily be disabled in Windows 7, and it gave slightly less input lag which meant I had more precise control and reaction time for my games and overall just better game feel. Do I directly notice when I just normally play a normal game with a controller? Hell No,  I ain't superhuman, but it's gonna impact gameplay unconciously and I DO easily notice the game feel is off. And I DO easily notice the difference when I play a game that uses a mouse. And if you for some reason have a laggy setup, it's gonna add.A lot of small Indie games these days lack an exclusive fullscreen mode (and note, you can't play them in in more than 60fps/ usually). While annoying, It's not as much of an issue because most of them were designed with that slight bit of input lag in mind and they usually don't involve precise control methods like mouse movements where it is much more noticable if its even sligthtly off.But emulators have been going with this trend as well. And emulators already have extra input lag unless you have features specifically made to counteract it like in Retroarch (provided that they work on that core and system power). So when I use PCSX2, the DWM lag stacks on top of that of the emulator, resulting in it feeling sluggish compared to the real thing (not that the PS2 was that responsive as far as I know, but comperatively speaking).At least the even oldder games were made with a different amount of lag in mind. Anyways, I try to royal guard in Devil May Cry 3 and it's just way harder to time, and there's less reaction time the game allows of me. It affects gameplay.  Try Royal Guarding on the  Standalone PC port of DMC3 in fullscreen and its night and day.All because Microsoft doesn't give a shit and most people don't notice and are used to it. In the 8 and 16 bit era most games were comparatively really responsive and we had CRT's. Nowadays, I went to a Japanese arcade and the only responsive games were the rhythm games. The rest were full of input lag, meanwhile the retro games in that arcade were incredibly responsive (if they weren't emulated).  Often when the few people who notice it complain about input latency, people respond acting like it doesn't exist. The only times people seem to care about input lag is when they play games where it directly impacts the base playability, or competetive games. Rhythm games like OSU for example.Windows 7 support is ending. And my only way to play games like I've always played them is Windows 7. What the hell am I supposed to do about that? I can do so much fancy shit with this very advanced technology, yet I can't do something this basic? It'd be much easier to have a version of Windows that can disable the part that creates the input lag than to ask every developer ever to add exclusive fullscreen including the ones who don't develop their old games anymore.. I get modern PC's are more complex. But this doesn't seem to be necessary at all.Edit: btw I don't know if it is input latency or display latency, but honestly that doesn't really matter.",windows

Thank youA elderly friend handed me their laptop and asked if I could help them download some software onto it.The Laptop has windows 8 and hasn't been updated in a very long time.The software they want is on Microsoft Store.The problem I'm having is that the store doesn't recognize the device so it wont let me download the software.Is there anything I can do to get this laptop capable of downloading software from the microsoft store?Steps I've taken:Updated the laptop as much as was available.Signed into a microsoft account on the laptop and in Explorercreated a new account and tried signing in with that.Help please!  I've been working on this for a couple days and my heads about ready to explode.  Thank you!https://i.redd.it/w8hkprocg5231.png,windows

623,"When I tried to update to 1903 with the assistent, it stated that I had a service or a driver that is not compatible with the new 1903. Thanks to [the Microsoft Forum](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/incompatible-applications/84822c03-b487-438e-8f4f-75d94a779edf) I could check my system for the specific incompatibility.As it turns out a BattlEye service was still on my system. The last time I used BattlEye was PUBG which I deleted months ago. But apparently BattlEye was not deleted in tandem with PUBG. Furthermore the tool linked above could not find the path to BattlEye's .exe.But I found under the services tab in the advanced view of the Task-Manager that there was a service called BEService. And it had a path to the .exe. But only deleting the .exe didn't solve the problem, since the service itself was still there and without a game/process to start the service and let BattlEye update so that I eventually could update to 1903 I had to delete the service as well. Thanks to [Sergey Tkachenko](https://winaero.com/blog/delete-service-windows-10/), I found a way to do so. And once done, I restarted, found the service deleted and the tool linked above did not show any more incompatibilities. Now I could properly update to 1903.I hope there are people out there who I could help with this.",windows

625,"Hi all, I'm currently working on a modified version of Windows 10 for a retrofit Xbox console. I was previously using Arch to get the software job done, but Windows just supports so many other games.With Linux, you don't have to use a Desktop Manager (Login Screen) if you don't want to.  I was wondering if I could do the same thing here in Windows, by either disabling the service or deleting files, but I don't know if it's possible. It just ruins the immersion seeing the Windows logon screen every time I start the console. I have already replaced explorer with my own frontend (just the gpedit.msc option), and this is the last piece of the puzzle missing. Thanks for any help you can offer!",windows

What I plan to do is to back up most of my stuff onto a 1tb portable hard drive and then restore once I've upgraded. I'm thinking of using [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXwMbmhCQuY)  guide to install win 10 via USB.  I'm going to use my product key that I used on my windows 7.The part that I needed help on is the backing up. I wanted to ask what you would do if you were in my position. Which files and folders would you back up on your pc and also which files and folders should I go through so I dont miss anything. The reason I ask is because I'm going to start by first backing up whats on my desktop. After that I'm not too sure what to go look through. Games and other applications I obviously wont back up. I'll just reinstall them.Another thing I was wondering was what would I do about game saves. Games like rainbow 6 I dont have to worry about because I'm sure that the data is saved online so I all I would have to do is reinstall and then just log back into my account. What about GTA V which has single player and multiplayer, how would I back up my progress. Same with Skyrim and the Batman Arkham games. How would I back those up.I'm not too keen on using online storage such as google drive as the portable hard drive is enough to put my files onto.Really do appreciate the help.",windows

They also want to make windows a “service”. This means slowly chipping away at what made windows great.

697,"Hi, guys! After hearing about the Youtube material design incident, I decided to make an extension that should in theory, permanently fix all the issues that are being faced with Google sabotaging insiders Edge. The extension is super simple and all it has to do is just be downloaded. It tricks all Google websites (only Google websites and Youtube) into thinking that the Insiders Edge browser you are using to access the website is Google Chrome. My question is, how can I publish this to the Insiders Addons Store? If I cannot, what are the alternatives? I'd rather not publish this to the Chrome store since it will most likely get taken down.By the way, I would just submit the install file, but for some reason, Edge does not accept extensions not installed from a store (it seems like an in development feature).Here is how it looks: [https://www.reddit.com/r/edge/comments/bu8ut4/how\_can\_i\_submit\_youtube\_edge\_fix\_extension\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/edge/comments/bu8ut4/how_can_i_submit_youtube_edge_fix_extension_to/)",windows

717,"I'm at a bit of a loss, as is our lead network engineer. About 3 years ago, we replaced an old Cisco ASA firewall with a new Palo Alto. All of a sudden all windows machines were unable to talk off their LAN. They could talk just fine on their own LAN, but could not ping their gateway. We came to find out if we ran an arp -a on the windows devices it was learning the wrong mac address for the gateway's IP address. Adding a static arp entry on each windows box has band-aided the problem, but I'm wanting to get it fixed for real. This seems to happen on both VM's and physical windows boxes on the network, but does't seem to affect anything else (several linux boxes, a dozen or so cisco switches, wireless radios, etc...). It also only seems to be related to the gateway address, as these windows boxes can arp everything else on it's LAN no problem. I'm not aware of any gratuitous arps, and have been unable to locate any via wireshark either. Until we put the static arp entries in new windows boxes, they seem to be arping with a destination of ""IPv4mcast\_3f:e0:01"" according to my wireshark capture. This is different than all the other arps that the same machine and other machine are making to the standard ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff address. This 3f:e0:01 is the mac address that gets added to the arp table if I do an arp -a on the windows box. Has anyone seen an issue like this before? It really has me scratching my head.

718,"I want to reinstall Windows (I used to do this every year or so back in the day, but I haven't with Windows 10 because it's such a pain). It's easy enough to do this with things downloaded from various services, but Windows 10 is weird. I'm specifically talking about huge apps like games. If I download a massive game like GTA5 from Steam, it's as simple as moving the files for the game somewhere else and then directing Steam to detect and verify those files after I reinstall the launcher, resulting in me not having to redownload a 50 GB game. However, if I move an app from the Windows 10 store in the same manner, this doesn't work? The store will never detect the files and allow me to use them unless I redownload them. I know that I can move apps from one drive to another. So if I were to move a large app like Shadow of War, a relatively large game, to a 2TB drive before reinstalling Windows on my boot drive... would I be able to recover it? Or would it just be the same as if I had moved it manually and screwed everything up?The apparent fact that Microsoft hasn't made this as simple as literally every other service is just nonsense to me.",windows

It's only a few months old, and was given to me by Apple after determining that my 2016 MBP was a lemon. Anyway, I use Adobe CC Photoshop 2018. I don't use the updated 2019 version because of a variety of changes they made that I'm not a fan of. I've never had a problem running it before, on the older MBP and initially not on this one. Now, every damn time I run the app it gets the internal fans running so loud I can barely hear any music or anything playing from the speakers. They're seriously running at maximum, it's absurd. This happens within minutes of drawing or editing anything. Even with no other apps running. And resetting the SMC and NVRAM (which Apple suggested of course) do nothing. The only other app that has this effect is Safari, amusingly enough. More than 5 tabs open? Burns hotter than hell. Both Safari and Photoshop are seemingly always ""using significant energy"" for even the most mundane of tasks. I cannot think of any good reason why this thing can't handle Photoshop. It's a £3000+ computer, customized for higher performance beyond the retail model, for f's sake. I've been using MBPs for years and never have I had so many issues before the TouchBar model came along. Seems like lately the nicer the machines look, the poorer their performance is.

For the last 7 years I have been basically saying I planned on getting a new Mac Pro, Mac Mini, or Macbook Pro - and for reasons (no Mac Mini upgrades until recently, no Mac Pro upgrades since Cylinder Mac Pro, and Macbook Pro overheating/KB issues), I have pushed this continually hoping the next Mac release would address enough of my concerns to finally warrant me opening up the wallet.At the moment I run a 2012 Mac Mini (Core i5) with 8GB RAM at home for mostly the odd iMovie project, and for Ableton Live. I have an old Linux Desktop (Quad Core) with 8GB RAM that I use for hosting Plex and running as a personal web server for projects. Windows 10 Laptop as my Daily Driver (16GB RAM, core i5)  When the new Mac Pro releases, it comes in 8 core to 26 core options. Is it something to consider, as a replacement for all three of these?

I am hearing that lots of people are considering the lowest spec model, with opportunities to upgrade later. One question I have, is the Processor capable of being upgraded after? Or is that one of the options that you must purchase outright (sort of like the Soldered ram or ssd in other macs)?Also, would having more cores not matter? - if the VM application is not capable of running off cores/threads in a way that something like the aforementioned setup would the system be bogged down if I tried to replicate some of my current HW set ups through a VM?Just some questions, thanks!",mac

88,"Alright, so I am switching from my old Nvidia GTX 980ti to the Sapphire Nitro+ Radeon RX 590 which supports Metal and Mojave. I know that the 2009 Mac Pro's can't upgrade to Mojave because it's version is Mac Pro 4,1 unlike the 2010 - 2012 Mac Pros which have the version 5,1. However, My Mac Pro has been upgraded when I bought it 3 years ago and says 5,1. So theoretically the RX 590 should work.

However, when I booted up games like Dying Light and L4D2, I noticed that I was getting frame drops down to a constant 24-30fps when I should be 60fps or higher.

135,"For years I have been working with a MBP that I hook to a 27"" display when I am at my desk. I had a Thunderbolt display and got the Ultrafine 5K when it came out. What's next? Here is my guess:Apple will probably release a new iMac that supports an Advanced Target Mode with:* eGPU support* Webcam/FaceID, USB/TB3 hub, Ethernet, SDXC, speakers/mic support etc.* Possibly sharing of other system resources such as disk, memory, CPU etc.Now this would be perfect for me, especially the eGPU part because I am at 13"" MBP user, and sometimes need a bit more GPU oomph but would rather avoid a bulky, and pricey, Blackmagic eGPU.I think there are a number of things that indicate that this may happen, in particular:* Discontinued 21"" and 27"" Ultrafines; this correspond to the iMac sizes* Expanded and improved eGPU support recently* Sidecar w/ iPad on macOS Catalina shows Apple is open to use main devices as peripherals and not just the continuity approach* The eGPU-in-display approach helps with breaking down some of the bandwidth barriers of current cable standards* FaceID will make it more important to offer the feature on external displays, plus this would explain why TouchID was skipped on keyboards. This is especially important if Apple brings in some extras with Mac FaceID such as gaze tracking to reduce mouse movements (and improve ergonomics).* Helps Apple with reducing SKUs and increases end-user value (free extra Mac!). eGPU support is the only way that the price of an iMac makes sense as a display purchase. Ultrafine 5K + Blackmagic eGPU w/ Radeon Pro 580 comes out at $2,000 MSRP which makes the high-end iMac 5K with the same GPU a pretty good deal ($300 more).Lots of different things need to happen to get there, including custom controllers chips, but it looks like Apple is getting there and this could come in the next or following iMac iteration.As a bonus my guess is that Apple may re-use the design investment of the XDR display stand to finally give us iMac's that are height-adjustable. Not that I care that much since I use a VESA arm, but it would be a good thing to provide a default with better ergonomics.",mac

171,"I've read good things about this website, which operates in several European countries, as well as Australia, so I decided to sell my Macbook Pro to them. I received a quote and found it acceptable, and they provided a UPS label to ship the computer to their office in Finland.They received the package on June 5. I was told it could take 5 business days until they had inspected it. After that they would issue payment. As of this morning, the computer is still in service control. I have sent numerous messages regarding the status of my computer and asking about payment. These have not been answered. I called them on Friday and they said they would have a manager call me back. Nothing.I tried calling again today. The number is not working/disconnected. Today, I will file a complaint with the Netherlands police, as I think they might have scammed me.Be careful if you plan on buying or selling from Mresell. I could be wrong, but my computer has been with them for nearly two weeks and they are uncommunicative and seemingly unworried about me receiving payment. Mrsell could very well be scammers or a fraudulent company. If anyone has any other advice about actions to take, I'd be glad to hear it.EDIT/UPDATE: They literally just responded after me sending out a flurry of emails to several different people. Their conclusion is that my computer has liquid damage and they will only give me 70 euros for it. This, compared to the 530 originally offered. The top case/screen was replaced by Apple less than a year ago (Staingate). Other than that, it sat on a desk in my house. There is a very, very small chance (if any) that it actually has liquid damage. Not sure what my next step is here, but I would never have sent it in had this been the case. It was running perfectly before this. It seems too convenient that after two weeks of silence this is what happens.",mac

181," TLDR: Is the 2019 MBP capable enough for 60FPS 4K video editing without dropping frames, and does not make the system sluggish while exporting H265? I make videos daily.The long story:I'm currently using the 2013 Mac Pro (Quad 3.7Ghz) for mostly photo editing and 4K 25FPS video editing.After upgrading to OS Mojave from OS 10.12, my system started to lag. There seems to be a split second delay whenever the processor is taxed while editing or exporting videos.I've been tempted to upgrade before but none of the Macs would actually help me save more time. The single reason that prevents me from upgrading is, this --&gt; **Processor speed is not the bottleneck as I can have the Mac Pro export videos overnight.** But now with OS 10.14 Mojave the split second lag, I may have to upgrade.Also, my camera can shoot 60FPS 4K but I don't record with that setting because the Mac Pro is just not capable of editing that unless proxies are created but that process takes time.Basically, I just want to upload my 60FPS 4K files from the SDcard straight into Final Cut Pro and starting working the moment the upload completes, not a second later.The price of the 2019 Mac Pro is out of my reach so I'm considering the MBP as a possible replacement for my Mac Pro. I don't want the iMac because I don't want the screen.I can also consider the Mac Mini 6-core if that's capable enough to work with 60FPS 4K videos with HEVC export.Anyone who has used the 2019 MBP or 2018 Mac Mini for daily intensive video, care to share your thoughts?",mac

186,"Hi /r/mac!Friend found a cheap new sealed 2017 MBP in a random store and wants to buy. They have an offline location in the city centre so are at least half legit. My guess the reason it’s almost $500 cheaper than official is because this store somehow brings them from the US without paying VAT - I can see how they can pull that off here in Ukraine.Most of the advice I found is for buying a used MBP and involves interacting with it (e.g. running hardware tests). However, this one is allegedly new and sealed, so have to figure out if there are any red flags`*` before unwrapping it.All I know is you have to look at the wrap seal line - it needs to be tight and in a form of a rectangle going right under where the box closes, i.e. not in the middle of the box. But I’m not sure anymore because [this says](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/buying-sealed-laptop-off-craigslist.1204375/#post-13098779) it’s not a big deal to rewrap the box as if it’s from factory.[This page](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/190783/how-to-know-that-a-macbook-pro-box-has-never-been-opened) says there has to be a label. Can’t remember it on mine, but it’s been a while. Is that correct?Basically I’m hoping there’s an online resource where you can enter a serial number and it’ll tell you if it’s allright, not stolen etc. For example [this post](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/buying-sealed-laptop-off-craigslist.1204375/#post-13098826) says to *check it online*, but doesn’t specify where exactly.They have a used MBP on display (with swedish interface and keyboard - very odd), I checked it's serial on [checkcoverage.apple.com](https://checkcoverage.apple.com/gb/en/) and it says ”valid purchase date” but I’m not even sure what that means.Please advise`*` for me this whole idea is a red flag itself, but he’s on a low budget, needs it bad, and these $500 make a difference",mac

234,"Hey all! I'm in a bit of interesting situation, after the reveal of the expensive new Mac Pro and the revelation that a 16"" MBP is likely not coming until at least next year (with all signs pointing to it being incredibly expensive when it does land!), I decided to build a PC for the first time in a couple of years as a new main workstation for general use, audio and photo editing. I'm planning to retire my current mid-2015 15"" w/ dGPU because I can probably still get at least $1100 or so for it (only 150 battery cycles and 512gb storage), and ""downgrade"" to a 13"" retina alongside my PC as a mobile companion since I'll no longer need the power or screen size and chassis weight of the 15.I found a local seller offering a mid-2014 13"" retina with a 256gb ssd, [this one specifically.](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.6-13-mid-2014-retina-display-specs.html) He only wants $500 for it and it appears to be completely mint condition with just 120 battery cycles. I think that's a pretty great price, but I've been out of the mac buying world for long enough where I wanted to run it by you guys and make sure that's, at the very least, ""fair"" value for the machine. I tried searching around on eBay to try and see if I'm getting a good deal comparably, but it's hard because a ton of sketchy refurb-sellers undercut almost all private parties. It uses a 4th gen cpu as do even the late 2013s, which really highlights how old my 2015 is getting (internally) at this point lol.",mac

This involved purchasing two external displays, a Magic Keyboard and hooking up my Logitech MX Master 2S Bluetooth mouse.Everything was good until, to my dismay, I found that when I disconnected from AC Power (I don't keep the Macbook charging past 100% as perpetual charging expedites battery degradation), the Mac goes into Sleep mode when the lid is closed, a behaviour which can be disabled directly within the settings for when AC Power is connected.Anyway, I searched for an alternative and found three forerunners:  InsomniaX (discontinued), Amphetamine (which does not support closed lid sleep stifling off AC Power and claims that it is impossible for Mac Store apps to accomplish) and [Anti Sleep](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/anti-sleep/id946798523?mt=12).The last one which I mentioned does exhibit this behaviour (contrary to Amphetamine's claims) but only enables the option for this in its Pro version, which is a subscription model.  Now I'm a software developer myself, and I fully understand that people have every right to derive revenue from their published works, but I'm not willing to pay a recurrent fee for something as trivial as this.So my question is, does anybody know of an app which can accomplish this behaviour without a subscription model attached?

Just to be sure. I can be wrong because I haven't really used it before.

I would be using my external usb disc drive to install the windows dvd i assume. I think those are the only things I have to worry about and it should be easy.

295,"Can I also charge my iPhone on my 2013 Retina MBP or the Lightning to USB-C cable won't fit? The reason I am asking is because I want to buy a 18W Charger + USB C cable to enjoy fast charging but I still want to be able to charge my iPhone during a flight on the regular USB port for example.Also, I am moving from wireless charging to fast charging for 4 reasons:1. Wireless charging is between 2x and 3x slower than fast charging2. Being able to use my phone while it's charging vs. wireless charging3. Wireless charging heats up the iPhone a lot; and for longer period than fast charging which damages the battery4. Wireless charging promotes overnight charging which is another big factor of battery deterioration. With fast charging, it prevents overnight charging because it charges much faster hence you don't have to wait as much time before plugging your iPhone off.

I purchased this software because an OS X update stopped working with Logic Studio ($600), but I wanted to hold out for Logic X.  I finally bit the bullet and purchased Logic 9, three months later, Logic X came out.  I tried to get them to upgrade my license but they refused to do so.A few years later, I was in the same boat.  An OS update stopped supporting Logic 9.   I thought, since this is just a hobby for me, I will just setup a Mac on Snow Leopard and continue using Logic 9, no more spending money on this nonsense.  So I did just that.  Setup Snow Leopard, updated to 10.6.8 to get the App Store, and tried to install Logic 9.  I can’t download it!  I contact Apple Support, and they tell me it is no longer available.  What!?  I spent $200 on this software and you are telling me I can’t download it anymore?!They tell me my only option is to buy Logic X.  Sadly, I am done sailing on this boat.  As soon as I buy Logic X, I guarantee you a new major update will release and the support clock will be ticking.  So if anyone out there is waiting for Logic 11, it is just around the corner based on how inaccessible Logic 9 is.   They really want to squeeze those last $$$ out of Logic X.So I am jumping ship.  I just learned that FL Studio is buy once, upgrade forever!  What a breath of fresh air after this nonsense.

This doesn't happen with every application, but it's pretty annoying, especially if I'm working on a project that requires multiple desktops to switch between apps.I know my Mac it's pretty outdated and that could be the core of the problem, but I hope someone has a solution for this",mac

423,"Apple just posted 7 new MacBooks up for registration, and I wanted to specifically discuss the likelihood of the 16"" redesigned MBP coming out this year.I'm going to college for CS and until today, I thought I'd get the 15"" 2019 Pro. But the posting of seven new models breaks the math on that somewhat, and if there is a decent chance the new Pro comes out this year, I'd like to wait.On the supporting evidence, Ming Chi Kuo hasn't yet revised his prediction that the new Pro will come out this year. 7 new models is a lot of models, and there seems to be historical precedent given the A2251 model number is similar to the old 17"" Pro's A1151. Some people are suggesting given how ""isolated"" this model number is, Apple will do what it did with the first gen Retina and release the 16"" first, before the 13. And Apple did used to release laptops on a 7 to 9 month cycle; the May release of the 2019 Pro seems to be them trying to both give it some time before it becomes obsolete too quickly, as well as an opportunity to try the 4th gen Butterfly keys before they come out on the new model (they're definitely not going away).However, a six month cycle seems to be a lot on the short side, and a 2020 release does seem more likely. Intel also has few, if any, new processors for Apple, since Ice Lake is only for &lt;15W.If the Pro is indeed coming out this year, I'd like to wait for it, and I'll have my current laptop reset, get a new battery and dual boot Linux in it for my classes.

I got a great deal, I'm very happy to have it, it's a really nice notebook, and it discharged itself admirably for my use-case. But there's one thing that's a pest: Something's killing the CPU. Activity Monitor says kernel\_task is using 70%+ of the CPU, constantly, it has 7:17:01.73 on the CPU time, and without control, the fans spin constantly. I did some googling and two things came up as culprits: That this is a way of throttling the system because it's running too hot, or there's a sensor issue that makes it think it's running too hot. Fixes seem to involve deleting chunks of the OS, which makes me nervous.I'm willing to try that, but I want to be sure I'm not missing something obvious.  I guarantee that it isn't *actually* running too hot. Absolute 100% put-it-in-the-freezer certainty.

460,"Greetings r/Mac hive mind.So my current Mac is a 2012 15 inch MacBook Pro (non-Retina) with the anti-glare 1680x1050 display 2.7Ghz quad-core (Ivy Bridge) i7. This machine has since been maxed out with 16GB of RAM and 2TB SATA3 SSD. (I also have it connected to 2 thunderbolt displays that I acquired second hand while I was attending school)This machine has been a very dependable workhorse that has gotten me through my undergrad program at school ( IT and CS related studies). The computer still runs pretty well, but it is starting to show its age. While I mostly use it for development much of it on the local OS with some testing in Docker containers. Some of my testing I do in virtual machines (which are running Docker containers) in VMware fusion to test different configurations. It is very easy to get this machine to ramp up its fans when a lot is going on. Virtual Lab setups in VMs gobble up RAM unfortunatelySo now that I am out of school and 2 years in my job (software developer) I am looking into replacing this machine.So I have been kicking around either the base model iMac Pro or an almost maxed out 2019 i9 iMac.If I were going for the iMac I would configure the following:i9 CPU8GB RAM (with the full intention of upgrading with aftermarket RAM after the purchase with a 32GB kit + 8 preinstalled to make 40GB total. Great for running multiple VMs at the same time and if my VM needs grow I can add more ram easily in a way that does not involve having to pay Apple RAM prices as I would with the iMac Pro) 1TB SSD (I HATE Apple SSD prices, but VM's can take a lot of space, and I do not want to bother with the fusion drive. Also, I do not want to offload those VMs to a NAS, and since I want to try to make this machine last as long as my current MBP I figure I would get more space than I strictly need right now)AMD 580x (adequate for my needs at present since I am not going do not intend to game on this machine, but I do see an eGPU in this machines future 3 or so years down the line)I may do some light video/photo editing on this machine for family stuff, but that is a side note.I will probably continue to use the thunderbolt displays (for now) with the new iMac since they are in good shape.While there is part of me that sort of lusts after the base model iMac pro and is tempted to stretch the budget for it, the rational part of my brain says that my use cases are more CPU bound. In those areas, I think the 2019 iMac configuration that I am considering can hold its own against the base model iMac Pro for my needs. And the main thing that I need is gobs of RAM which the iMac makes super easy to add.Also, in my case, the lack of a T2 chip in the machine is an asset since that opens the door to install things like Linux on it down the road.But with what I have presented so far is there a reason in which I should consider the iMac Pro for my use cases (other than lusting after pretty hardware ;) . Which will cost $1000 more than the iMac config that I have in mind).",mac

472,"Hello everyone. I am having a very tough time deciding which system to get to replace my 2017 iMac.  I was deciding between a Mac Mini and MacBook Pro initially, but now I might be considering an iMac.  I have discussed this a few times the past few weeks and here is what I have on this topic. The Mac mini still has weaker processors now compared to the latest iMac (no 8 core option). I have to be honest, I am not a fan of the iMac's display. No height adjustment and it is very tall. It has such massive borders around the display too. And my 2017 iMac does have a display issue which means my entire computer needs to be sent in. I prefer to use my own monitors and am free to hook up a 144 Hz display for some gaming.  With the iMac, I can use a secondary display so it’s not a huge deal. I do a lot of Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro X. I do very little 4K stuff, most of my content is still 1080p. I do use HEVC for the file size benefit. So maybe the Mac Mini with the T2 chip is better? However, I think FCPX is more bursty so higher amount of speed is better than core count right? I am not a fan of the built in graphics of the Mac mini. The new Mac Pro is obviously out of my price range at the moment. Especially since I can get a similar specced iMac (without Xeon and ECC memory, but core count) and have it a couple thousand cheaper WITH 1TB SSD is very desirable.I DO plan to do some light gaming on this by booting into Windows. Games like Borderlands (including the new one coming out), Factorio, Terraria, Doom 2016, and GTA5 to name a few. As long as I can do 2560x1440 at 120+ fps on my 144 Hz display, I am fine. I do not need 4K gaming or anything like that. So with the Mac mini, I would need an eGPU anyway. At least with the iMac, I will get a fairly decent dGPU and I can still opt for an eGPU later if necessary.I believe, while some people have issues with it, the T2 chip will make HEVC exports MUCH faster than the iMac right? The 8-core iMac would be about $500 more than the 6-core Mac Mini and has a decent video card already. I am just really REALLY not happy with all-in-one systems. Sure the 5K display is nice, but it is much better for me to have matching monitors and I need height adjustment too.  But this not not a deal breaker if the iMac is the better choice. I am just not sure which system to get. 1080p HEVC (purely for the file size benefit), very light 4K editing, Logic Pro work, software development, light gaming in Windows and more. I am not editing 8K footage here. SO I don't think I need to maxed out iMac right?  How about in 4years?  Should I get the 8 core iMac for future proofing?Thanks for the advice!",mac
474,I am going back to university within the next 2 months and have been looking to get a MacBook Pro. I’m currently studying in my 2nd year of computer science and physics.I could save up enough money over 3 months to buy a species out 2019 13 inch MacBook Pro but I’m wondering if it would be better to spend around $1100 for a decent used MacBook Pro 13 inch 2015 then wait for the 2020 model and possibly even wait for the 2021.I was hoping for some advice on if people thought saving for 3 months for a 2019 model is better then buying a 2015 model now then using that for the 2020 or 2021 model.  Regardless I would need to get a laptop within the next 3 months so I can't just wait out the next model.,mac

498,"Having sold my 2017 MacBook Pro Non Touch Bar for a 2018 MacBook Air, I thought I’d share my thoughts on the swap. TLDR, it’s a mixed bag. Owners of the 2018 MacBook Air, I’d love to hear your thoughts.• I vastly prefer the keyboard on the 2018 MBA over the 2017 MBP NTB. The differences to a layman may be imperceptible but after living with the two, I prefer the feel and sound of the 2018 design. Is it the best keyboard in the world? Absolutely not. We need a keyboard with a bit more travel and complete reliability, but the 2018 is a step up from the 2017, in my opinion.• I still prefer the screen on the 2017 MacBook Pro. While I had thought that the brightness was too strong at times, especially in the evening, I’m now clamoring for the full wide color gamut screen. The 2018 MacBook Air is certainly a massive leap forward from the old non-retina design, but I find myself raising the brightness only to find I’m at max brightness. I can only imagine how dark it was before they updated the settings to reach 400 nits of brightness.• The processor power on the 2018 MacBook Air just doesn’t meet my needs. I wouldn’t consider myself a power user but with enough Safari tabs opened, especially with streaming video, the MacBook Air will freeze up and become sluggish. I don’t recall such an experience on the 2017 MacBook Pro NTB.• The tapering on the MacBook Air feels better on my wrists when typing. Not a massive benefit but a nice to have.Closing thoughts: What I’d really like to see is a 2017-style MacBook Pro NTB but with a 2018 or 2019 keyboard. I would opt for the new, more powerful MacBook Pro models with the Touch Bar but I prefer a physical function key row. Or, said another way, the 2018 MacBook Air with a stronger processor and a 500 nit, full wide color gamut screen. I highly doubt we’ll see an update to the MacBook Pro NTB, and I doubt we’ll see massive processor improvements to the MacBook Air in the near future, so I will continue to dream.

510,"Hello!I own a 2015 MacBook Pro 15” (the 512GB + dedicated GPU if it matters). It is almost 4 years old and has around 600 charging cycles. I worked on it daily, I took it with me everywhere from the sea level to 2500 meters altitude, I never took any special care of the battery (sometimes I charged it twice a day) but I never dropped it and I avoided every shock.Yesterday I opened it up for dust cleaning and reapplying thermal paste and I found the battery like this: https://imgur.com/gallery/Ge27oju . The yellowish dots on the left part of the battery is just dust.I don’t know if it’s really swollen but in the past couple of months (up to one year) I had constant messages (in the menu bar) to service the battery. It was disappearing after a SMC reset and it was appearing again after a while. Before leaving it in service, the battery menu was displaying “Condition : normal” without any SMC reset. The reported stats from Coconut were something like: 80% battery life, condition: good. I assumed it was a sensor reading error.Today I took the laptop to an authorized service (since there is no genius bar service in Romania) since it’s my primary “workstation” and I can’t risk having it broken during any important events. I hate the 2016+ models and I don’t want to change it until another true MacBook appears.What do you think? Was the battery really swollen or it was just air between the black paper and the battery itself?Also, a friend of mine had the same issue 1 year ago and he got his battery (and also his display?!?!?!?!) changed for free in the same shop. He had the exact same laptop (2015 15”) but without the discrete GPU. My colleague had his laptop on the desk the entire time, permanently connected to the power supply.

I really like the sound and firm feel of the keyboard, however, I don't feel confident if I have pressed the key firmly enough.

I've always liked the Minis and as a professional video editor and occasional colorist I'd prefer to use an NEC or Eizo monitor to Apple's iMac screen. I also need more than two USB-C/TB3 ports and figured if I was going to sink $300 into a dock I might as well put that money towards a new machine. I was hoping to get the Mac Pro, but after seeing Apple's price tag there's no way in hell I'll be able to afford it in the near future.So my questions are: Would a maxed-out **2018 Mac Mini (3.2GHz, 6-core i7, 64 GB RAM)** outperform a **2017 27"" iMac (4.2 GHz, quad-core i7, 48 GB RAM)?** Or more generally, does anyone here use the 2018 Mini for video editing, and if so how do you like it? I would primarily use it for editing 4K footage and photo retouching. The Geekbench scores put the Mac Mini above pretty much everything except a few configurations of the current Mac Pro and the iMac Pro, but I wonder if the hit on the processor would matter to me. Also, despite it being very relevant to what I do, I know very little about graphics cards.Price isn't an issue. I already have a buyer lined up for my current iMac which would offset most of the price of the Mini.Bonus question, and maybe the only thing holding me back from making the purchase right now—anyone want to groundlessly speculate with me on when Apple might refresh the Mini with an i9 chip? I could see a silent refresh in October, in which case I'd gladly wait. It could also be two years.Thanks for any replies.",mac

I am an IT Tech with only a handful of Mac users, and one of them is having issue connecting to their network shares over WiFi. Other Mac users have been able to connect fine, though they are mostly on High Sierra.Essentially, we have a corporate WiFi that is on-domain so you can access network shares anywhere you can connect to the WiFi. All other network activity on the MBP is fine, but when using Command+K to connect to any server through SMB, it all of a sudden can't connect when it worked fine either over VPN or ethernet over TB. I did notice that once the connection to the server was established either over ethernet or VPN, if you drop that connection and only use the WiFi, the user can navigate network shares just fine unless they drop WiFi completely and have to reconnect to the share.This change only seems to be an issue now that we have changed our main WiFi network to login using network credentials and the EAP-FAST protocol instead of a password, though this appears to have been natively supported in MacOS for years.

I opted for the refund since I could just buy a 2017 MBP now, and I had to do it over the phone since I ordered online.I started that process, and straight away they told me that they don't usually do refunds, but after looking at the notes the Genius had written down and the history of my device they decided to put me through the process. After providing proof of purchase I was asked if I was just going to use the refund money to buy a new Mac and I said yes, that's when I was hit with the amazing news that I could get a new 2019 replacement for my 2016 one.It was shipped quickly and the customer service rep was always in contact and replying to my emails, all in all it took around a week from when I made the call to Apple care to when I picked up my new laptop. It sucked having my 2016 constantly breaking, but in the end I guess it was well worth it haha. (oh yeah my 2016 one also made a popping sound every now and then that was driving me insane)TL;DR My refurbished 2016 MBP kept breaking in one way or another and I decided to chase a refund and Apple offered to give me a brand new 2019 MBP at no cost.",mac
624,"OK, so I am currently on a 2010 5,1, 2.8 GHz quad core.I updated the RAM and Hard Drives, and also have added a second optical drive, but everything else is stock.I have been waiting for the new Mac Pro to drop, as while my computer still works rather well, I can not updated to the newest Mac OS, and I am also seeing some indications that the graphics is starting to fail (little coloured squares in both black and white areas on both of my monitors).  However, now that it has, the price to feature ratio of the new Pro is leaving me underwhelmed.  Particularly at the low end that I can actually afford despite saving up in anticipation.  As much I I would love a maxed out one, it just is not in the cards.I mostly use my computer as a general computer, with some gaming and I dabble a bit in Daz rendering, although I have cut down on those due to the aforementioned potential graphics issues.  I have been considering getting a bit more into the development side of Daz, but with my current setup having a hard time with some of the features, not even counting the Nvidia situation, I have not gone further than thinking about it.So my choices are upgrades to my current setup, Windows, or a Hackintosh.  I want to stay with the Mac OS, and frankly I am not comfortable with the amount of tweaking needed for the latter (although I might reconsider in the future), so I am looking at upgrades.So with all that in mind, I was poking around on OWC, and [this is what I came up with.](https://imgur.com/ER5bWiT)  As far as I can tell, this will max out the internals, allow me to update the OS at least for a bit longer, and the USB cards will add some expandability options for external upgrades.  And even with shipping it will still be cheaper than the new ProMy main question is if there will be any conflicts between the two USB cards.  Anyone have any thoughts or any other suggestions?",mac
625,"Hi, I guess I've been pretty lucky up until now. As of late (and not consistently), my 2016 15"" w/touchbar MBP keyboard has been acting up. Nothing serious, but the spacebar will hit twice instead of once. I've noticed because most text automatically puts in a period when you do a purposeful double space in most applications. This seems to happen about 2 out of 10 times on average. I've used canned air and done my best to keep everything clean.I do have AppleCare; but I use my MBP as my primary driver and travel quite a lot.  Since it isn't happening consistently, if I contact Apple for support will they just turn me away if they can't replicate my problem consistently? Thoughts before I reach out to them?

The 2012 5,1 cMP has a chipset limitation.. it doesn't properly recognise hard drives over 2TB so what was needed to get around that was a boot-level patch in the EFI to be recognised. Apparently patch interferes with large-volume support of APFS, so it has been removed.My understanding is that the only workarounds are: * Remove drives that are larger than 2TB from the system, reboot and see if bootcamp will work. I haven't this yet.. but I don't know if it will work, regardless..* Find another way to install Windows 10 instead of using Bootcamp.So.. on a 2012 Mac Pro.. what can I use to install Windows 10 on a drive without using Bootcamp?  From what I understand all bootcamp really does is provide you the drivers and utilities for running Windows on your mac pro as well as configuring the the system to recognize that there's a Windows volume that you can boot so I'd guess there's another boot manager of come kind that's available to help with this.Suggestions?

Also, if I were to plug in any USB device to the right side while the mouse is plugged into the left, both the keyboard and mouse stop working completely. No issues using both if the mouse is on the right.To clarify if that was confusing: when plugging in USB bluetooth mouse - right USB port good, left port badIs this an issue with the USB port itself? Or could the mouse/keyboard be drawing too much power? Other USB devices seem to work fine if they use the left side. This normally wouldn't be an issue, but I made a new dock setup and the left side is toward a wall. Which would be fine, if I could plug my mouse into that side and free up the open USB.",mac

811,"I recently bought a new MacBook Pro 2018 model (i7-8750-H, 256 GB SSD). The performance so far has been really good. The fans turn on very rarely. Even if they do, they are very quiet. Noticing temps using intel power gadget, I observe that the temps were jumping up to 98-100 degrees Celsius while uploading files to OneDrive/unzipping a tarball. This was around 20 GB of data consisting of small files, thus high clock speeds were expected (if no thermal constraints were present). The processor did touch 4.00 GHz (while sustaining 3.90 GHz for most of the time). IMO, the temperatures are too high and at these temperatures I expected the fans to be as loud as an aeroplane taking off to Miami.Note that the laptop killed 25 per cent of battery power in this task (in approx 30 min). Ambient temperature is around 27 degrees.I am concerned if this is by design or defect. I know that I can control the fans myself using 3rd party apps, but I would like to report this issue to Apple customer service if this behaviour isn’t normal.

886,"They did a very good advertising here.Short: It's guerilla marketingLong: Let me explain.If you look at it without knowing anything, especially as a simple human being who doesn't work in design related things, the 1000$ will look as a rip-off. Eventually, more and more people will hear about it, and more professional people will buy it because of the memes in internet and so on.Especially since apple just got on this market from a long time, it needs marketing.Is the stand really worth 1000$? Of corse not.I guess that they could send the monitor for like 5.8k$ and the stand for another 200$ but this will look as if the monitor is expensive. More expensive than the 5000$ barrier to be exact.What they did there, is they sell the monitor below the psychological barrier of 5000$ (4999$) and the people think that it's a reasonable price for this monitor.In the end, apple still makes 6000$ as they would if selling the monitor with the stand for 6k$, or monitor for 5.8k$ and the stand for 200$.Just the marketing is better, and this will result in more sales. I mean, who will buy a monitor without a stand?Good job apple marketing team, you've done great!",mac

941,"Apple just released a display stand, a _stand alone_ stand for a fricking 1000$. And everybody has lost their minds. Even the literal audience in the audience left an audible gasp when they said ‘1000$’. But in all reality, it’s not really _that_ big of a deal.Firstly, for all those who don’t know about the ‘professional’ community, consider them as rIcH aSs InDiVidUals, who _need_ great hardware for their bread. The pro industry is extravagent, with literal 30-50$ things costing half grands. Consider a professional level Hollywood camera: a red 8k Monstro VV. It costs 54,500$, just for the sensor and the brain. The lens mount? Extra 700$. Handle? Extra. Case? Extra. 7 inch monitor for preview? Extra. All in all some cameras may cost over 250,000$.Another industry: music. Software amd hardware for pro level music production systems can cost anywhere b/w 25k to 75k. Consider these professionals, not as single individual but a company as a whole, already used to buying 19,000$-45000$ 4K reference monitors for years, see a better 6K display with equivalently specced pixels and cooling for a fourth to a ninth of the price, on sale. Guess what? They’ll purchase it. They’ll hella do. They don’t care if it costs an extra 1000$ to have a stand, that actually isn’t a _bad_ stand at all. They’ll buy it, probably not one but 2-3 for each studio, and just be happy with the upgrade they got, and the money they saved.The pro industry is massively luxurious, and ridiculously overpriced, simply because it’s not a single guy buying them, it’s an enterprise level of investment, not a person looking forward to using it as a tv. It’s for making money, and people are ready to pay the price.All this, but I’d still say the stand is overpriced for what it is. It’d be overpriced at 500$. But for an enterprise, who are used to paying triple the cost of the PD-XDR even with the stand, they couldn’t care less.Have a great week all of you :)Edit: spelling",mac

971,"Apple don't want to make the stands, neither the stand or the VESA mount.It is a liability to them in case it breaks or the customer dishonesty claims that it broke because it would damage the whole display.They have had issues with the display mounts before, and being burnt by it (in their eyes) they would rather that the customer get an unsupported 3rd party stand so that they don't cop the blame for failures.Source on high failure rate: https://iphone.appleinsider.com/articles/18/05/30/flaws-in-apples-imac-pro-vesa-mount-fueling-new-episode-of-repair-anxietyObviously they have to offer an official option of some sort, but an excuse now not to include one in the price,  they only offer two expensive options.The $1000 stand is really whats termed ""fuck off pricing"" they REALLY dont want to sell it, but if they do it comes with a higher profit margin and an insurance policy for themselves in case it breaks the whole Display.The $200 is the same but less risky. They will probably train their staff to blame thr VESA stand itself as much as possible rather than the adaptor if anything gies wrong. By making the full stand $1000 it makes the VESA look ""cheap"" in comparison. But $200 for VESA, really? They are charging a high premium either way.Both are priced high to avoid the desire to swap.But what they really want if they can't guage you for one is to get a third party one which they take no responsibility for. Of course what they could have done was design the mounting mechanism to be more sturdy, but that just isn't the Apple way, they would see it as an admission that their earlier stand design was flawed.They won't do that because they take personal insult to the idea that their products contain flaws, they will fight tooth and nail to avoid a recall no matter how big or small, and double down on the designto prove to themselves that it's not flawedThe stand situation is a classic Apple move.I expect to see many stand failures in the coming months.",mac
